    To authenticate by adding your personal access token to your ~/.npmrc file, edit the ~/.npmrc file for your project to include the following line, replacing TOKEN with your personal access token. Create a new ~/.npmrc file if one doesn't exist.

    ```//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN```

    or 

    To authenticate by logging in to npm, use the npm login command, replacing USERNAME with your GitHub username, TOKEN with your personal access token, and PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS with your email address.

    $ npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
    > Username: USERNAME
    > Password: TOKEN
